# reinforcement_learning
Repository containing implementations of RL (reinforcement learning) algorithms, specifically from "Sutton, Richard S., and Andrew G. Barto. Reinforcement learning: An introduction. MIT press, 2018." Eventually I hope to also add implementations of more cutting edge RL algorithms directly from the literature.
